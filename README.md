# WalnutCreekCitizenSurveyData

# Objective
Use Walnut Creek’s Citizen Survey data to make recommendations to City Staff about which parts of the community to engage as we pursue the City Council’s strategic priorities. For example, is there a particular segment of the population who might be most concerned with the City’s work on housing affordability and availability, or the update to our Economic Development Strategic Plan?
